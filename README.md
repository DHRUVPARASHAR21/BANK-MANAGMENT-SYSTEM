# BANK-MANAGMENT-SYSTEM
DAY 1
Inside the window, you see the following components:

A large title saying "Welcome to ATM."
A label for "CARD NUMBER" with a text input field.
A label for "PIN" with a password input field.
Buttons for "SIGN IN," "Clear," and "Create Account."
The "Clear" button erases any text entered in the input fields.

The "SIGN IN" and "Create Account" buttons are not connected to any action yet, so they don't do anything when clicked. You can add functionality to these buttons later.

The code also handles the appearance of the input fields. For example, the card number field has a specific font and size.
